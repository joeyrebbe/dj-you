## Technologies Used 

* node.js
* express
* mongoDB
* EJS


## Getting Started 

To use the app, [login]() and create an account with your email and password. Once you're set up, it's time to make a playlist! Give your soon-to-be masterful curation a title from your profile page, then Click **Create Playlist** 

From there, click **Add Songs To Playlist** and fill out the descriptors. A song title is mandatory, but the rest are optional. Once you've filled everything out, click **Save To Playlist** and voila! Your ecclectic tastes are now saved to your profile.

## Next Steps

Here are some icebox items that are next in line for DJ-You.

1. Link one more external API: [getsongbpm](https://getsongbpm.com/), and use it and [theaudiodb](https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php) to search songs that are pre-populated with information. 

1. Add a "Search User" feature, so that your friends can see what good taste in music you have.
